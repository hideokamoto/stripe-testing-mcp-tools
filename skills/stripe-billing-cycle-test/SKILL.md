# Stripe Billing Cycle Test

Standard procedure for validating that a subscription bills correctly on its
next cycle by simulating time with a Stripe test clock. All steps run against
Stripe **test mode only** (the MCP rejects live keys).

## Order matters

The steps below are strictly ordered. A customer can be attached to a test
clock **only at creation time**, so the clock must exist before the customer,
and the customer before the subscription.

## Steps

1. **Create the test clock.**
   Tool: `create_stripe_test_clock`

   - `frozen_time` (required): Unix timestamp in **seconds** for the starting
     time.
   - `name` (optional): a label to find it later.
   - Keep the returned `test clock id` for the next steps.

2. **Create a customer attached to that clock.**
   Tool: `create_stripe_test_customers`

   - `test_clock`: the id from step 1.
   - `number`: keep it at most `3` (max 3 customers per clock).
   - `payment_method_id` (optional but recommended): attach a test payment
     method (for example `pm_card_visa`) so the renewal invoice can be paid
     instead of staying open. Confirm against the Stripe docs which test
     payment method fits the card behavior you want.
   - Keep the returned customer id(s).

3. **Create the subscription.**
   Tool: `create_stripe_test_subscription`

   - `customer`: the id from step 2.
   - `items`: array of `{ price, quantity }`. The `price` must be a recurring
     price id from your test data.
   - `proration_behavior` (optional): `create_prorations`, `none`, or
     `always_invoice`.
   - `payment_method_id` (optional): the same test payment method.
   - This creates the first invoice for the current period.

4. **Advance the clock to the next billing date.**
   Tool: `advance_stripe_test_clock`

   - `test_clock_id`: the id from step 1.
   - `frozen_time`: a Unix timestamp (seconds) **after** the current frozen
     time. Advance is forward-only; you cannot move a clock backward. Pick a
     time just past the subscription's `current_period_end` to cross the
     renewal boundary.

5. **Wait for the clock to become ready, then verify.**
   - `advance_stripe_test_clock` returns the clock `status`. Advancing is
     **asynchronous**: do not run follow-up steps until `status` is `ready`.
     The tool reports the status in its response text; if it is still
     `advancing`, wait and confirm it has settled before continuing.
   - Then confirm the new invoice for the renewed period was generated and has
     the expected amount and status. Inspect this in the Stripe Dashboard
     (test mode) or via the Stripe API, since the MCP does not expose an
     invoice-listing tool.

## Notes

- `frozen_time` is always a Unix timestamp in seconds (not milliseconds).
- Customers created by this MCP carry `metadata.generator =
stripe-testing-tools-mcp`, useful for locating and cleaning them up later.
- For cleanup after verification, see the `stripe-test-data-lifecycle` skill.
- For the full list of test-clock constraints, see the
  `stripe-test-clock-constraints` skill.
